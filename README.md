# React Clock

Following an example on [reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html) demonstrating state and lifecycle in react.

### Key Takeaways

* Define component as a class the component requireS a local state
* lifecycle methods **componentDidMount** and **componentWillUnmount** are very useful to perform actions and clean up.
* Always start component names with a capital letter
* Extract larger component into smaller ones
* Props are read only! Always aim to write pure functions, don't change the inputs
* All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.
